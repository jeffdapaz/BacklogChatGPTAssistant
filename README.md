üëâ For Visual Studio 2019: [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jefferson-pires.VisualChatGPTStudio2019)

## Description üí¨

This is an extension that adds chatGPT functionality directly within Visual Studio.

You will be able to consult the chatGPT directly through the text editor or through a new specifics tool windows.

Watch here some examples:

[<img src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/63928228/275614252-5f824ba6-df13-45e3-928e-086609fe1bcd.png" width="70%">](https://youtu.be/eU5hEh6e5Ow)

## Features on code editor üë©‚Äçüíª

Select a method and right click on text editor and you see these new chatGPT commands:

![image](https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio2019/2.1.0/1697062741546/image__2.png)

- **Complete:** Start write a method, select it and ask for complete.
- **Add Tests:** Create unit tests for the selected method.
- **Find Bugs:** Find bugs for the selected code.
- **Optimize:** Optimize the selected code.
- **Optimize (Diff View):** Optimize the selected code, however, instead of the result being written in the code editor, a new window will open where you can compare the original code with the version optimized by chatGPT.
- **Explain:** Write an explanation of the selected code.
- **Add Comments:** Add comments for the selected code.
- **Add Summary:** Add Summary for C# methods.
- **Add Summary For Entire Class:** Add Summary for entire C# class (for methods, properties, enums, interfaces, classes, etc). Don't need to select the code, only run the command to start the process.
- **Ask Anything:** Write a question on the code editor and wait for an answer.
- **Translate:** Replace selected text with the translated version. In Options window edit the command if you want translate to another language instead English.
- **Custom Before:** Create a custom command through the options that inserts the response before the selected code.
- **Custom After:** Create a custom command through the options that inserts the response after the selected code.
- **Custom Replace:** Create a custom command through the options that replace the selected text with the response.
- **Cancel:** Cancel receiving/waiting any command requests.

And if you desire that the responses be written on tool window instead on the code editor, press and hold the SHIFT key and select the command (not work with the shortcuts).

## Edit the Commands üìê

The pre-defined commands can be edited at will to meet your needs and the needs of the project you are currently working on.

It is also possible to define specific commands per Solution or Project. If you are not working on a project that has specific commands for it, the default commands will be used.

Some examples that you can do:

- **Define specific framework or language:** For example, you can have specific commands to create unit tests using MSTests for a project and XUnit for another one.
- **Work in another language:** For example, if you work in projects that use another language different that you mother language, you can set commands for your language and commands to another language for another projects.
- **ETC**.

## Features by `Visual chatGPT Studio` tool window üõ†

In this tool window you can ask questions to chatGPT and receive answers directly in it.

![https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio2019/2.6.0/1709307485035/image__6.png](https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio2019/2.6.0/1709307485035/image__6.png)

This window can also be used to redirect the responses of commands executed in the code editor to it, holding the SHIFT key while executing a command, this way you can avoid editing the code when you don't want to, or when you want to validate the result before inserting it in the project.

## Automatically create comments for your changes üìë

In this window it will also be possible to create a git push comments based on pending changes by clicking on this button:

![https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio2019/2.6.0/1709307485035/image__9.png](https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio2019/2.6.0/1709307485035/image__9.png)

No more wasting time thinking about what you are going to write for your changes!

Through the `Generate Git Changes Comment Command` option of this extension, you can edit the request command. Ideal if you want comments to be created in a language other than English, and/or if you want the comment to follow some other specific format, etc.

You will find this window in menu View -> Other Windows -> Visual chatGPT Studio.

## Features by `Visual chatGPT Studio Turbo` tool window üöÄ

In this window editor you can interact directly with chatGPT as if you were in the chatGPT portal itself:

Unlike the previous window, in this one the AI "remembers" the entire conversation:

![image](https://github.com/jeffdapaz/VisualChatGPTStudio/assets/63928228/ff47bf5c-8324-46ba-a039-173c172337e0)

You can also interact with the opened code editor through the `Send Code` button. Using this button the OpenAI API becomes aware of all the code in the opened editor, and you can request interactions directly to your code, for example:

- Ask to add new method on specific line, or between two existing methods;
- Change a existing method to add a new parameter;
- Ask if the class has any bugs;
- Etc.

But pay attention. Because that will send the entire code from opened file to API, this can increase the tokens consume. And also will can reach the token limit per request sooner depending the model you are using. Set a model with large tokens limit can solve this limitation.

By executing this command, you can also hold down the SHIFT key when press the `Send Code` button so that the code will be write directly in the chat window instead of the code editor, in case you want to preserve the original code and/or analyze the response before applying it to the opened code editor.

You will also be able to keep multiple chats open at the same time in different tabs. And each chat is kept in history, allowing you to continue the conversation even if Visual Studio is closed:

<img src="https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio2019/2.4.0/1700946186856/image__8.png" width="60%">

You will find this window in menu View -> Other Windows -> Visual chatGPT Studio Turbo.

Watch here some examples using the Turbo Chat:

[<img src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/63928228/275615943-a37e30c3-d597-42de-8a38-7d0cdbfe942f.png" width="70%">](https://youtu.be/2NHWWXFMpd0)

## Features by `Visual chatGPT Studio Solution Context` tool window üìå

<img src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/63928228/282463640-4e7c24c6-41d5-4cee-aa36-f363daba6f95.png" width="75%">

Here you can add project items to the context of requests to OpenAI. Ideal for making requests that require knowledge of other points of the project.

For example, you can request the creation of a method in the current document that consumes another method from another class, which was selected through this window.

You can also ask to create unit tests in the open document of a method from another class referenced through the context.

You can also request an analysis that involves a larger context involving several classes. The possibilities are many.

But pay attention. Depending on the amount of code you add to the context, this can increase the tokens consume. And also will can reach the token limit per request sooner depending the model you are using. Set a model with large tokens limit can solve this limitation.

You will find this window in menu View -> Other Windows -> Visual chatGPT Studio Solution Context.

## Features by `Visual chatGPT Studio Code Review` tool window üîç

The Code Review Tool Window feature is designed to enhance the development workflow by automatically generating code reviews based on Git Changes in a project. This innovative functionality aims to identify potential gaps and areas for improvement before a pull request is initiated, ensuring higher code quality and facilitating a smoother review process.

<img src="https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio2019/2.7.0/1711660202615/image__5.png" width="75%">

### How It Works

1. **Git Changes Detection:** The feature automatically detects any changes made to the codebase in Git.

2. **Automatic Review Generation:** Upon detecting changes, the system instantly analyzes the modifications using the power of AI. It evaluates the code for potential issues such as syntax errors, code smells, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.

3. **Feedback Provision:** The results of the analysis are then compiled into a comprehensive code review report. This report includes detailed feedback on each identified issue, suggestions for improvements, and best practice recommendations. 

4. **Integration with Development Tools:** The feature seamlessly integrates with the Visual Studio, ensuring that the code review process is a natural part of the development workflow. 

5. **Edit the command:** Through the extension options, it is possible to edit the command that requests the Code Review for customization purposes.

### Benefits

- **Early Detection of Issues:** By identifying potential problems early in the development cycle, developers can address issues before they escalate, saving time and effort.
- **Improved Code Quality:** The automatic reviews encourage adherence to coding standards and best practices, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Streamlined Review Process:** The feature complements the manual code review process, making it more efficient and focused by allowing reviewers to concentrate on more complex and critical aspects of the code.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** It fosters a culture of continuous improvement and learning among the development team, as the automated feedback provides valuable insights and learning opportunities.

## Authentication üîë

To use this tool it is necessary to connect through the OpenAI API, Azure OpenAI, or any other API that is OpenAI API compatible.

### By OpenAI

1 - Create an account on OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com

2 - Generate a new key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

3 - Copy and past the key on options and set the `OpenAI Service` parameter as `OpenAI`: 

<img src="https://github.com/jeffdapaz/VisualChatGPTStudio/assets/63928228/09a93cc9-c35d-4fee-b3a1-05f2dd0212f1" width="75%">

### By Azure

1 - First, you need have access to Azure OpenAI Service. You can see more details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext).

2 - Create an Azure OpenAI resource, and set the resource name on options. Example:

<img src="https://github.com/jeffdapaz/VisualChatGPTStudio/assets/63928228/8bf9111b-cc4d-46ac-a4f2-094e83922d95" width="60%">

3 - Copy and past the key on options and set the `OpenAI Service` parameter as `AzureOpenAI`: 

<img src="https://github.com/jeffdapaz/VisualChatGPTStudio/assets/63928228/2f881df1-a95f-4016-bf39-9cf2e83aef0e" width="75%">

5 - Set the Azure OpenAI API version. You can check the available versions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#completions).

### By Others Customs LLM

Is possible to use a service that is not the OpenAI or Azure API, as long as this service is OpenAI API compatible.

This way, you can use APIs that run locally, such as Meta's llama, or any other private deployment (locally or not).

To do this, simply insert the address of these deployments in the `Base API URL` parameter of the extension.

It's worth mentioning that I haven't tested this possibility for myself, so it's a matter of trial and error, but I've already received feedback from people who have successfully doing this.

## Known Issues ‚ö†

Unfortunately, the API that OpenAI makes available for interacting with chatGPT has a limitation on the size of the question plus the given answer.

If the question sent is too long (for example, a method with many lines) and/or the generated response is too long, the API may cut the response or even not respond at all.

For these cases I advise you to make requests via the tool windows to customize the question in a way that chatGPT does not refuse to answer, or try modify the model options to improve the responses.

## Disclaimer üëã

- As this extension depends on the API provided by OpenAI, there may be some change by them that affects the operation of this extension without prior notice.

- As this extension depends on the API provided by OpenAI, there may be generated responses that not be what the expected.

- The speed and availability of responses directly depend on the API provided by OpenAI.

- If you are using OpenAI service instead Azure and receive a message like `429 - You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.`, check OpenAI Usage page and see if you still have quota, example:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63928228/242688025-47ec893e-401f-4edb-92a0-127a47a952fe.png" width="60%">

You can check your quota here: [https://platform.openai.com/account/usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)

- If you find any bugs or unexpected behavior, please leave a comment so I can provide a fix.
